Time flies when you're having fun.

Before you know it, your little babies have started school, you celebrate the _30th anniversary_ of Jurassic Park, and that little blog you started have now been going for 15 years.

_15 years_ is a long time; longer than I've been waiting for _Winds of Winter_, the next Game of Thrones book.

---

It's not always so great to be reminded of how old you are.

- My kids have started pointing out that I'm wrong about lots of stuff.
- Russia invaded Ukraine 2 years ago.
- Trump became President almost 8 years ago.
- Jurassic Park was released _30 years ago_.
- Inglorious Basterds and Avatar came out 15 years ago.

i. I've been blogging for 15 years.

I've been blogging for longer than I've been waiting for _Winds of Winter_.

Time flies when you're having fun.

Before you know it your knees starts hurting, you get tired before midnight, your kids are correcting you on mistakes you're making, and that little blog you started some time ago, Jurassic Park came out over 30 years ago?

# Why I started the blog

I started this blog because I wanted to create a bunch of [fast game prototypes][games] and I wanted somewhere I could write about my plans and, ultimately, the games.

You see, I was a budding programmer and I wanted to learn how to program by making a game.
Not a simple game like _Tetris_---that would be way too sensible---no, I wanted to make a big RTS game, like [StarCraft][] or [Supreme Commander][].
And to do that you needed a *game engine*.

So I got stuck developing my engine with awesome features such as:

- A menu with keyboard and mouse support, and cool hover effects.
- A console you could bring up with `F2` where you could update variables (such as unit speed) without having to recompile.
- You could select entities with proper `Ctrl`, `Shift`, and right click behavior.

... But, embarrassingly, I didn't have anything even resembling a game, and with the development speed I had I doubt I'd be finished to this day.

I'd gotten stuck in the *Game Engine Trap*, and I hated it.

Then I found _The Experimental Gameplay Project_ (of [World of Goo][] fame) that promoted the idea that you should be able to create a game prototype in just 7 days.
That sounded like the perfect cure against the *Game Engine Trap* (it was), so I created this blog to document my progress.

# Why I've continued to blog

While the blog fulfilled it's initial purpose as I developed around a dozen [game prototypes][games] that got me out of the *Game Engine Trap* (and that gave me a small "game engine" library at the end), I soon started write about other things.

There are a number of reasons that I've continued to blog for so long:

1. I enjoy writing.

   I realize now that the biggest reason I blog is that I enjoy the writing process.
   I can't put my finger on _why_, I just like it.

   This isn't always true though and I've had years where I've barely written anything at all ([2022](/blog/2022) for example).
   Sometimes I've had to force myself to write something.
   I guess the motivation ebbs and flows sometimes.

1. Writing helps me think more clearly and helps me flesh out ideas.

   The act of writing something down helps me find errors in my thinking and helps me consider different viewpoints.
   Rewriting the text you've written has a similar benefit to refactoring your code; your thoughts will be more polished afterwards.

1. Publishing something forces me to do better.

   If I'm going to put something out there I'm going to re-read and rework my text/code/ideas one or two times more than if I had kept it for myself.

   For example, [my custom keyboard layout][t-34] wouldn't have been nearly as well-developed if I hadn't published it for everyone to see.
   (Even if nobody will read your posts, the mere act of putting something out there has this effect I think.)

   Being more thoughtful about what I write is something I've become more cognizant of as the years have gone by.
   My first posts where little more than a stream of thoughts, while the larger posts I gravitate towards today have gone through multiple revisions and rewrites before I publish them.

   ::: note
   At any time I have several drafts that I'm writing on, but many of them never gets published.
   Sometimes I lose interest, and other times I see that the post won't become the polished masterpiece (or at least, not a pile of dung), so I abandon it.
   :::

1. The blog is a place to document my personal projects.

   Over the years I've done [other projects](/projects) than [making games][games], such as [built a 3D printer][VORON] and [wrote a book][crypto].
   It's nice to have a place where I can write about them.

1. Looking at a log of things I've done makes me feel better.

   I've been doing a small [yearly review][] every year where I try to list the highlights of the past year.
   (The blog helps me remember what I've done.)
   It's been super helpful for me as it helps counteract the [depressing feeling][burnout] that nothing has happened and that I haven't done anything.

   Doing a yearly review of some sort is a practice I highly recommend everyone to try---and of course you don't have to publish it for everyone to see.

1. I enjoy developing the blog as a project that exclusively solves my problems.

   Programming is my biggest hobby and I'll never stop doing it until I die.
   The blog is a great project as it's something that exists only for me so I can rewrite, refactor, and add whatever silly features I want and I only have myself to answer to.
   It's a nice feeling.

1. Blogging helps me become a better writer, which in turns helps me become a better developer.

   I think communicating well is an important and underrated part of being an effective software developer.
   Writing well is a skill that can be developed by practice, and maintaining a blog is a pretty good way to practice I'd say.

   ::: important
   No, dumping a stream of thought into ChatGPT isn't good enough.

## My motivations aren't dependent on external feedback

It's important to point out that it's not external feedback that has kept me going all these years.
Yes, of course, it's nice to get the occasional email with compliments, but that's just a bonus.

{=I keep this blog for me to write, not necessarily for others to read.=}

Many of these kinds of retrospectives contain graphs of views over time or the most popular posts; but I don't have them because I can't---I don't keep any statistics whatsoever.

I don't really care, and I don't want to care, about how many readers I have or what posts are and aren't popular.
I worry that if I add statistics to the blog it'll change from an activity I perform for the activity's sake, to an exercise in hunting clicks where I write for others instead of for myself.

If I were chasing views I would certainly not have continued to blog for as long as I have, and I'd have missed out on the [many benefits](#Why-Ive-continued-to-blog) I've gotten from the blog.

# Evolving the tech stack

The tech choices I've made for this blog have oscillated between chosen because they seemed interesting, to boring and utilitarian, and back again.
At the moment the blogging software is a whole project in and of itself, in addition to writing the blog posts
(by design; it's a fun project to tinker with.)

{.blog-tech-stack}
::: timeline
: ~ 2008 .kohana

  I started out with PHP using the [Kohana Framework][] and I still have fond memories of their excellent documentation.
  Although I had figured out how to create a website, it never graduated to a real blog.

: Early 2009 .mojolicious

  Then I moved on to rewrite the site in Perl using [Mojolicious][].
  I'm not sure my efforts ever resulted in anything tangible but I remember if was fun to play around with.

: July 2009 .jekyll

  I stumbled upon the idea of using a static site for my blog and therefore abandoned Perl for [Jekyll][], a popular static site generator at that time.

  I believe it was a smart choice because it helped me [start writing][first], instead of jerking around with cool tech.

: ~ July 2013 .hakyll

  Eventually, I grew tired of the boring backend that just got the job done and in my quest to learn Haskell I replaced the generator with [Hakyll][], another static site generator with a pretty neat DSL.

: 2013â€“2022 .hakyll-space

  Sadly, I never truly graduated from the "throw shit at the wall until it sticks" stage of my Haskell journey, which is why I barely added any features to the blog for many years.

: August 2022 .rust

  Having outgrown existing solutions I decided to join the Rewrite in Rust club^(cult?)^ by
  [rewriting my blog in Rust][rust-rewrite].

  Religious weirdness aside, having complete control of the site generator made it fun again to [tinker and add small features][microfeatures] to the blog.

: 2023 .css

  Honestly though, my favorite piece of technology on the blog is [CSS][].
  I just really like to spend time to fiddle with [the design][design] and to make small tweaks here and there.
  I do use [Sass][] but 95% is just plain CSS.

  Modern CSS is honestly great.

: February 2024 .djot

  Almost by accident I [started using Djot][] instead of Markdown to write my posts.
  I couldn't find a Tree-sitter grammar for Djot [so I created one][djot-treesitter].

: May 2024 .neovim

  I'm in the process of [connecting the site generator to Neovim][extending-neovim] to provide autocomplete, diagnostics, jumping between posts, and other cool features.

  There's lots of potential for spending _tons_ of time in this swamp but these IDE-like features really elevate the writing experience.
:::

# Posts have massively increased in scope

# What does the future bring?

People are quick to point out that they're not the same person they were a decade ago, yet they're sure they won't change much the coming decade.
While it _feels_ like I'll keep blogging the same way I'm doing right now, it would be foolish to claim that as a fact.

I'll probably keep blogging in some capacity, but the topics, frequency, and length will likely all change.
