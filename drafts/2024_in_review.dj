# Nerdy things I enjoyed

- I read a lot of fantasy books this year!

  My favorite new series were [The Kingkiller Chronicle][], [Gentlemen Bastards series][], and [The Stormlight Archive][].

  ::: tip
  If you're curious about Sanderson's books but a little apprehensive about jumping into a massive series such as [The Stormlight Archive][] then I'll recommend [The Emperor's Soul][] as an excellent little introduction.
  The standalone book [Warbreaker][] is also fantastic (available [for free on Brandon's website][Warbreaker]).
  :::

- Customizing Neovim was fun and rewarding.

  It's amazing I got anything productive done this year...

- I still really enjoy Rust.

- [Types are coming to Elixir][elixir_types] and I'm loving it.

  (I recently migrated some small projects to v1.18 and found a bunch of errors.)

- The [Gleam programming language](https://gleam.run/) shows a lot of promise.

  My one gripe is the pain of manually encoding/decoding JSON (even with the various libraries) that's is annoying enough that I've avoided using the language for some projects.

# Lessons I learned

- CSS is alive and better than ever.

- 3D printing is fun and useful.

- I realized that [meta-blogging][] is a great way to get [virtual points on Hacker News][].

# Things I accomplished

- I quit my job and started my own company.

  At the moment I'm focusing on consulting but maybe something else can grow from it one day?

- I [wrote 24 blog posts](/blog/2024/)---it was quite a productive blogging year for me.

- I built a [custom keyboard][] together with a [custom keyboard layout][].

- Made the eBook for [Why Cryptocurrencies?][] freely available and finally finished the [How I wrote 'Why Cryptocurrencies?'][crypto-series] series.

- I wrote a [Tree-sitter grammar for Djot][].

  ::: warning
  I need to be more active maintaining it...
  But it's fairly hard to get motivated to fix weird esoteric edge-cases that are kind of hard to solve and other projects are constantly begging for my attention.
  Managing an open source project is not for the faint of heart (or with the easily distracted mind).
  :::

- Finished the blog series about [building my first 3D printer][].

- [Rewrote my lighting home automation][] from Python to Elixir.


# Tentative plans for 2025

- For some reason the idea of writing a fantasy novel got stuck in my head.

  The last weeks I've listened to dozens of hours of advice for aspiring writers but I don't know if it's a temporary thing my mind just happened to latch onto or if it's something I'll actually end up doing.

- Design a one-handed keyboard layout.

  Again, this was just something my brain got stuck thinking about and I'm not sure if it's just a fleeting idea or something I _need_ to do so I can stop thinking about it.
  (Sometimes just a little planning plus solving the most difficult problems are enough---I don't have to finish all the crazy/dumb ideas I get for my mind to consider them "done".)
