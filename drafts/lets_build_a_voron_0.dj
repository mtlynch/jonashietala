# Why another printer?

# Why a VORON 0?

# Waiting to build

I ordered a VORON 0 from [Lecktor][] in February and it took roughly 4 months before I got the _first_ shipment of parts and it wasn't until the end of 2024 that I had received all the parts needed to complete the build.

The wait was annoying...

::: warn
While I can't complain about the quality of parts, with the massive delays I regret ordering from [Lecktor][] and I would've been happier with an LDO kit from [3DJake][], like I was first considering.

## Printing parts myself

So what do you do when you can't start the build?

Of course, you print parts!

There's something very satisfying with printing parts you then build a printer with.

This time I wanted to make a colorful printer and I came up with this mix of filament:

- [PolyLite ASA Yellow](https://www.3djake.com/polymaker/polylite-asa-yellow)
- [Formfutura EasyFil ABS Light Green](https://www.3djake.com/formfutura/easyfiltm-abs-light-green)
- [Formfutura EasyFil ABS Light Blue](https://www.3djake.com/formfutura/easyfiltm-abs-light-blue)
- [Formfutura EasyFil ABS Magenta](https://www.3djake.com/formfutura/easyfiltm-abs-magenta)

## Dragon Burner toolhead

I got the parts needed to build the standard mini stealthburner...

But I'm attracted to playing around with new stuff and I decided to try out the [Dragon Burner][] instead.
I went with it because it's quite popular, it has good cooling (I print a bunch of PLA), and I haven't tried it out yet.

## Galileo 2 standalone

![Dragon Burner together with the Galileo 2 extruder mounted on the printer.](/images/voron_0/dragonburner_mounted.jpg)

For the extruder I opted for the standalone version of [Galileo 2][].
I've [used Galileo 2 on the Trident](/blog/2024/02/27/lets_build_a_voron_more_mods#Galileo-2) but I hated the push down latch it uses in the Stealthburner configuration and when the extruder broke (it pulled out a heat-set insert) I went back to the Clockwork 2 on the Trident and rebuilt the Galileo for the VORON 0 instead.

The build was really fast and simple---compared to Stealthburner it's night and day.
