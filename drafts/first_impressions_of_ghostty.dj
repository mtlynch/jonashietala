# I just want a blank canvas without any decorations

One of the big selling points of [Ghostty][] is it's [native platform integration][native].
It's supposed to integrate well with your window manager so it looks the same and gives you some extra functionality...
But I don't know why I should care---I just want a big square without decorations of any kind.

You're supposed to to be able to simply turn it off:

```ghostty
window-decoration = false
```

But at the moment [there's a bug](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/2023) that requires you set some weird GTK settings to fully remove the borders:

```ghostty
gtk-titlebar = false
gtk-adwaita = false
```

It's unfortunate that I have to tinker with these settings as I haven't done any GKT configuration on my machine (I use a tiling window manager without any GUI elements anywhere).

::: note
There might some useful native features I don't know about.
The password input style is neat, although I'm not sure it does anything functionally different compared to other terminals:

# Minimum contrast

Unreadable `ls` output is a staple of the excellent Linux UX.
It might sometimes look like this:

![](/images/ls_unreadable.png)

Super annoying.

You can of course configure the `ls` output colors but that's just for one program and it won't automatically follow when you `ssh` to another server.

[Ghostty][]'s `minimum-contrast` option ensures that the text and background will have enough contrast to always be visible:

```ghostty
minimum-contrast = 1.05
```

![](/images/ls_readable.png)

Most excellent.

# Hide cursor while typing

```ghostty
mouse-hide-while-typing = true
```

Another nice little feature is the ability to hide the cursor when I'm typing.

# Cursor invert

```ghostty
cursor-invert-fg-bg = true
```

In [alacritty][] I've had the cursor invert the background and foreground and you can do that in [Ghostty][] too.

I ran into an issue where it interferes with [indent-blankline.nvim][] making the cursor very hard to spot in indents (taking the color of the indent guides, which is by design low contrast with the background).

Annoying but it gave me the shove I needed to try out different plugins to see if the problem persisted.
I ended up with (an even nicer) setup using [snacks.nvim][] that didn't have this issue:

![Left: [indent-blankline.nvim][] (cursor barely visible)\
Right: [snacks.nvim][] (cursor visible and it highlights scope).

# Consistent font sizing between desktop and laptop

With [alacritty][] I have an annoying problem where I need to use a very different font size on my laptop and my desktop (`8` and `12`).
This wasn't always the case and I think something may have changed in [alacritty][] but I'm not sure.

[Ghostty][] handles this nicely and I can now use the same font settings across my machines (`font-size = 16`{lang=ghostty}).

# Ligature support

The [issue for adding ligatures to alacritty][alacritty-ligatures] was closed eight years ago
and even though I wanted to try ligatures I couldn't be bothered to "run a "low quality fork".

[Ghostty][] seems like the opposite of "low quality" and it renders [Iosevka][]'s ligatures very well:

![My configured ligatures of Iosevka, rendered in Ghostty.](/images/iosevka_ligatures.png)

Overall I feel that the font rendering in [Ghostty][] is a little better than in [alacritty][], although that might be recency bias.
I'm still undecided on ligatures but I love that I can try them.

I use a [custom Iosevka build](/iosevka) with these [Ghostty][] settings:

```ghostty
font-family = IosevkaTreeLig Nerd Font
font-style = Medium
font-style-bold = Bold
font-style-italic = Medium Italic
font-style-bold-italic = Bold Italic
font-size = 16
```

# Colorscheme

While [Ghostty][] has an absolutely excellent theme selector with a bunch of included themes (`ghostty +list-themes`) [melange-nvim][] wasn't included, so I had configured the colorscheme myself:

```ghostty
# The dark variant of melange
background = #292522
foreground = #ECE1D7
palette = 0=#867462
palette = 1=#D47766
palette = 2=#85B695
palette = 3=#EBC06D
palette = 4=#A3A9CE
palette = 5=#CF9BC2
palette = 6=#89B3B6
palette = 7=#ECE1D7
palette = 8=#34302C
palette = 9=#BD8183
palette = 10=#78997A
palette = 11=#E49B5D
palette = 12=#7F91B2
palette = 13=#B380B0
palette = 14=#7B9695
palette = 15=#C1A78E
# I think it's nice to colorize the selection too
selection-background = #403a36
selection-foreground = #c1a78e
```

# I'm happy with Ghostty

::: note
Did I create a custom highlighter for the Ghostty configuration file just to have proper syntax highlighting for this one blog post?

[You bet I did][ts].

(It's a simple [treesitter grammar][create_ts].)
